continuing to revolve round the sun, ceased to rotate on its axis. The
sun would be sor ever in the same meridiam but in summer it would
be seen higher in the sky - that is, nearer the North Pole; — in
autumn, it would go lower- that is, nearer the South Pole — until

it disappeared beneath the horizon lor six months. This supposition aids

Wyclif to explain the sun’s yearly apparent passage through the signs
of the zodiac, by imagining an eastward movement‚ which in some un·
known manneris delayed to the extent ol about one degree every day3
while the sun's position in the sky changes at the same time lrom North
to South, or vice versa.

Other divisione of movement. Wyclis here deals only with local
movement, unilorm or varied; and if varied, varied either in itself or in
its subject. ΙΙ the world revolves with a movement that seems uniform,
each part os the world turns round with a different degree of rapidhy,
except at the poles, where the movement is nil. All these various rapi·
dities of movement may at once be predicated os their one subject -
the world. It thus at the same time moves faster and slower than itsell:
which of course, with the above explanation, is evidently true. Wyclil
goes larther, and 'asserts that the motion ol a part may be equal t0,
though less than, that ol the wholc; notwithstanding that this admission
lends a handle to sophistieal objections, A movement smaller in velocity¹
is equal to the whole movement in duration. The circular movement of
a part os the world near the poles is much less rapid than at the
Equator3 yet both take place in 24 hours (28). Movement is again either
uniformly or variably varied; and once more the old mediaeval distinction

¹In velocity. The assertion that apart ol any movement is equal to the
whole is explained in the text by the distinction: quoad molem — quoad duraciouem.
Ι lind it difficult to understand. The sense, as l give it above, does not, Ι confess,
agree well with quoad molem3 it ought to be quoad velocitatem. But we might
understand the words thus: Movement in one arom only (a part ol the whole
movement quoad molem) is equal to the movement ol the whole body moved. But
then, why does Wyclif use the words quoad duraeionem? They ought again in
this case to be changed for quoad velocitatem. Ι think that the explanation, as given
above, answers better to the general drift of the argument. Either way, we see how
may be maintained that a partial movement is equal to its wholc, ·- Ι may here,
by the way, repeat what Ι pointed out in the Introduction to Logica‚ Vol. ll, viz.
that Ι in this analysis osten introduce comparisons or remarks of may own, in order
to clear up what is not clear, or to reconcile seeming discrepancies.
