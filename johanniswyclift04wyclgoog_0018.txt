XII INTRODUCTION.

of movement tvaried in the subject' comes in. Movement variably varied
may be so in infinite manners, and endless new species of movement are
thus conceivable. At this stage of the enquiry, Wyclif proposes three
questions; the first, dealing with succession, is to be solved in the follow·
ing chapter; the second concerns the Continuous, and the third, the
measure of velocity of motion, and will be answered here (29, 30).

Is tte Continuous ntnde up os points? Argumentis pr0. - lf the
world consists oi atoms which in their turn consist of indivisible points,¹
how can we explain the existence of the Continuous, which is indefinitely
divisible? How can the Extended be made up ol elements which are
in no wisc extended? But Wyclif says that it must be so, and gives
seven arguments to prove it. - 1. The intrinsic cause of anything is
necessarily a part of that thing; now points cause lines, lines surfaces,
and surlaces volumes; thus points are parts ol space, and it is ulti·
mately composed of them. - 2. Either points are not, or they are, parts
of lines; if not, all the points in a line could be taken away without
shortening it: a manifest absurdity. - 3. If two bodies touch in one
point only, we have two points which touch one another, and yet are
distinct (as belonging to different bodies); that is, t'hey are not in the
same place. So we see that ‘to touch³ does not mean ‘to coincide’,
and the possibility of space consisting os contiguous points is saved
(30, 3 ). — 4. An instant is to divisible continuous time what a point

is to a divisible continuous line; but one instant is not identical with the

next immediately following it: consequently‚ neither is one point identical
with another that it touches. And if s0, the point is, not the negation,
but the clement of the Continuous (31). - 5. Amobile, passing through
two surlaces that touch - air, v. g. and water - will pass one aster Ἴ
the other, and touch each of them at two indivisible instants of time,
distinct, though not separated by any interval. Other suppositions lead

¹Boskowitch's theory of indivisible points- mere mathematica} centres oi
attraction - which is well-known to the philosophical world, would seem sorne-
what similar to that of Wyclif. But there is an enormous differente. Boskowitch's
atoms do not touch, they cannot touch, they act upon each other with attractive
and repellent forces through a perfect vacuum. Thus his theory, though lying open
to other objections cannot be assailed by those which Wyclif here undertakes
to refute.
