created, is absolutely necessary. A further proos is in the impossibility
os a vacuum: is a piece of bread be annihilated, what rcmains in its
place? Nothing thinkable; and, therefore, annihilationis unthinkable too.

Wyclif is thus forced to deny that anything can be annihilated‚
,i even by Almighty Power, even absolutely considered,· and here we see
the profound difference which separates him from the general opinion ¹
of Scholastic philosophers and theologianS, who distinguish between
what is possible to Omnipotence, irrespect'ively ol God’s other attributes,
hut are not all of one mind asto whether annihilation is absolutely
impossible. They would willingly grant the truth of Milton’s lines in the
second book of Paradise Lost:

....How Hecan
ls doubtful; that lle never will, is sure.
But Wyclis has no doubt at all on the matter.

Now, in the doctrine of Transubstantiation, it is affirmed that the
bread censes to exist. This (though some Doctors of great note, Aquinas
amongst others, explain it in a different manner) certainly seems to point
to annihilation, as was very probably admitted by Wyclil’s Nominalistic
opponents. Atany rate, the assertion that the whole substance of the
bread ceases to exist at a given instant - both as to its substantial
qualities and the underlying substratum of those qualities — could, in
Wyclis's system, be understood only as the annihilation of the atoms of
, which it consists. This had to be denied. The bread, it was assumed,

Ἰ ceased to exist as bread,· in its place there remained a body that
  Wyclif (no doubt out of respect for the dogma which he still seemed

l to admit) called a corpus ntathemalicum. Isay, ‘still seemed to admit’;
for, 'as we have seen, this corpus mathematicum, quite orthodox enough iu
the ordinary sense of the words, is nothing else hut the atoms, or mathe-
matical points, of which the bread consists, justas they were before.
Any one who will read p. 137 of the present volume will, Ι think, be
convinced that the successive stages of Wyclil's opinions in this matter,
as given by Wodelord (see De Benedicta Incarnacione, ed. Mr. Hatris,
lut. IX.) were successive only in the mode of expression, not in the
thing itsell. The same esse, he says, which was previously that os bread,
becomes sacramentally the Body of Christ. Troe, he also says that it
does not remain bread after consecration, and explains himself no
further3 but the indestructibility ol the bread-atoms has already been
