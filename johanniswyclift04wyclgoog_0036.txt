from the varying senses 01 the word together. Two things may be said
10 be together, i. e. both occupying exactly the same space (an abso·
lute impossibility) or contiguum, each being in different places, or both,
though separate, being contained in the same larger space. As to time,
absolute simultaneity is possible (157). This answers, most 01 the objec-
tions. Alwoys may be understood as meaning eternity, or during all
eternity, or in some port of all eternity. The last sense is 01 001130
widely different from the others, and in this sense alone, whatever is
future or past is always (158). We may see a thing, though we do not
300 tbe whole thing; just sn, a man may exist in the ΧῐΙἹ century, though
non-existent during a part 01 the xa century (158, 159). To maintain
this, however, we must say that time 0013131301 instantaneous elements.
For, 11 11311113 110 101 parts 01 time, then instantaneous events (such
as cognition, division, 810.) could not be said to exist at any time, having
10 duration. And il not at any time, their contradictories would be true
in all time, notwithstanding that they also would be true. 11 cannot be
said that, from non-cognition to cognition, there is a change which im-
pliestime; lor lrom one contradictory 10 another, there is no real change.
'Ibat which is not white now, 11 11 any time it is to become white, cannot
receive the predicate 01 mere non-whiteness: so non-existence in a part
01 time is not non-existence in that time. After death, a man is neither
simply non-existent nor existent: he is non-existent then (160, 161).
Corollaries -- Time, the duration 01 the world, began with the
world, and with it must last eternally; necessary to the creation 01
the world, it does not depend on anything but the general 110101 move-
ment. 1100131313 01 indivisible 11311113 13 113 010110113; these are abso-
lutely without magnitude, and time itsels is everywhere, indivisibly the
same throughout the universe (162). As the world is everywhere, 30 13
time, and 30 13 God (163). What begins and ends intime (13 001·
ruptible entities); what makes up the very essence 01 time (as an instant);
what has modes 01 being measured by time (as the heavens), may be
called temporal, but in different 301303 (165, 164). Time is in 113011 a
cause 01 dissolution, lor it causes things 10 grow older; but occasionally

it is a cause 01 productiori, since it renders their production possible. Its
