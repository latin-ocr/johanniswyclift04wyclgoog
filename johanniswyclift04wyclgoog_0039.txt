lNTRODUCTlON. XXXI

is notin God’s power that Ι (10 not exist. But tehen must anything
exist? At a moment known to God (179—183). The simultaneity of life
and death would, as already stated, require them both to take place at
the very same instant. Time exists, but its parts do not all exist note,

only one at 3 time. Noto is but one mode of an existence which not
Ι note does not destroy. An instant tlten, norv, and to corne exists dif-
ferently, but cannot at any time be called simply non-existent. Antichrist
must come: therefore he tras come ...in the future. That is a modal,
but a real existence. lt was never true that I am not. To exist and not
to exist are contradictories; they may be true of the same being, but
notin the same Non). God knows past, present and future things with
the very same knowledge, yet this does not argue sameness in the
object known. Light is not affected by the presence or the absence
of the object illuminated. God may know present and future things as
past, if they exist in time; things eternal are eternally present; such, for
example, as the archetypes of what was, is, oris to be (183--188).
Here Wyclif again returns to his adversaries' favourite argument, viz.
that black is white, and all contraries identical. But one remark of his
is worth noticing. A proposition may be true, and yet false at any finite
part of time; as, for instance: <All the instants of time exist’. This is
true only for and in endless time (188-191).

An eternat antecedent does not necessarily conse its consequent in
tinte. — lf it did, all things would be eternal. God eternally knows and
causes all that which exists temporally. The extrinsic act of God, termin-
ated in the creature, is, as tltns terminated, neither eternal nor neces-
sary; the intrinsic actof His being is eternal and changeless (191, 192).

A coense produces its effect before enar effect exists. That is, before
its existence it is producing it, but not now; in the future. The ideal
being of the effect depends upon its cause, and is produced by it
before the moment when its real existence has to be actuated. On the ·
other hand, cause, qna cause, and effect, 313 simultaneous. Many things
are neither instantaneous nor temporal; v. g., certain etemal truths‚ and
beings of which the existence is intermittent. Wyclif here wonders how

the writers of his time can oppose'his system, which is confirmed by

the very expressions they employ; and lte blesses God, who has enlightened
him that he may escape the difficulties in which they are entangled
(192-195). *· The necessity of sin depends on our own free-wilk the
