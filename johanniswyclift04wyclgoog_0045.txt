INTRODUCTlON. = XXXVII

to sayiug that, however infallible the deductive prOcess, however evident
the first principles srom which we start, we are still liable to be mistakeu,
because things may be otherwise than as we know ¹them to be. To assert
that all is matter, and that even the acts ol our mind are material,
notwithstanding our conscious certitude that there is an abyss between
the two, is to set down that whateverwe know, no matter how indu· Ἴ
bitably, may be salse if it goes beyond material facts, and laws relative
to matter. Again, the statement (which would ruin Metaphysic, il Meta·
physic could be ruined by man) that at the bottom ol all our inquiries
into first principles, we 'find sels-contradictions and absurdities in every
possible assertion on either side; and that consequently though we can
know neither space nor time, we must confine our investigations to
that which is conditioned by time and space: - this well-known
doctrine is based upon the denial that things are as we know them.

The quarrel between Realists and Nominalists is thus an important
phase, but only a phase, ol the everlasting struggle between two op·
posite currents ol thought.'1 call it everlasting, for though the forms may
vary, it is likely to spring up for ever, or at least so long as human
curiosity as regards such high and abstruse matters continues to exist.

Not that there is uo answer to the problem‚ no middle way
between the absolute affirmative ol one class ol philosophical thinkers,
and the uncompromising negative ol the other class. But in this very
answer we find the reason why itis not universally accepted as settling
the point in dispute.

Do all things existas they are known by us? As is a very short
word, and (it would seem on a superficial view) not equivocal' in the
least. But let us consider it more closely. Things seen in a looking-
glass both are and are notas they are in reality. There is a certain

resemblance, more or less perlect; but the difference between them is

that between the image and the original. In the same way, so faras
any comparison is possible, the human intellect is the mirror ol
Nature. Our thoughts are the images of things; but we canno more
conclude that things are ol the nature ol our thoughts ,than we can
infer that a nosegay out ol a looking-glass is of quicksilver amalgam,
because in the looking·glass it is imprinted upon quicksilver. Thus,
things exist as they are known by us: that is, we have the right,
they being the causes ol our thoughts, to make certain inlerences
