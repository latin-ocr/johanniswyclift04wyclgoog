from the eflects to their causes; inferences necessarily vague and
indeterminate to a great extent, but none, the less true, on account ol
the necessary resemblance between the image and that which it images.
Even a shadow, however distorted and indeterminate, bears some
resemblance to the person who casts the shadow. But on the other
hand, things do not exist as they are know by us, il as means a
complete identity of nature between the known and the knowledge
thereof. For that which is the known, is such only from one point ol
view, orat best only from a few points: it — i. e. the same that which
(as Wyclil would say} -is the Unknown from millions ol other points
ol view. All the sophisms in the world cannot get the better ol this
distinction, by which all similitude of nature between knowledge and the
known is excluded, whilst similitude ol representation is carelully maintained.

But itis precisely this auswer, though given by many great minds,
both amongst the ancients and the moderns, that lails to satisfy by its ·
very moderatiori. We long to get behind the ‘Thiug-in-itselP, and if we
find we cannot, we cry out that there is nothing at all outside the
mirror; or, after many a squabble, weary ol disputes, we deny that we
can know anything of that which the images represent, and that all
science ought to be concerned with the images alone and their relations
with each other. And thus the disappointment caused by the perlectly
natural and simple answer given above leads to two contrary excesses
ol thought Some, yearning towards the Absolute, conceive endless systems
by which to go beyond the limitations ol the mirror: systems belorehand
doomed to lailure as hopeless as the search after perpetual movement.
Others think that the contrary extreme is the only tenable position, and
reject even such limited inserences as may justly be drawn, nay, that our
very nature compels us to draw. Those aspire to be as Gods; these
are content to thr ow away part ol the inalienable birthright of men.
wyclif‚ I think, belongs to the former category. His system was, partly
at least, amistake; but it was the mistake ol a bold, powerful, and com·
prehensive mind. He and all those ol his class were philosophers, gifted
with a mighty grasp of thought, and immense mental acumem whilst the
otherS, however ingenious their subsequent endeavours to reconcile their
principles with facts, must, by the laying down ol those very principles,

strike at the root of all philosophy, and even of human reason itself.
