XXX INTRODUCTION.

extensible to corporeal beings. According to that doctrine, the duration
of Angels, from one thought to another, may last for centuries without
change - centuries that are for them but one indivisible instant. This
is generally allowed, and lhave not anywhere been able to find any
trace of the actual extension of the doctrine to bodily substances. But
it may be explained as follows: Supposing that, at the present moment,
God suspended every movement in the whole universe for a hundred
years -- like the tale of the Sleeping Beauty on a gigantic scale -
and then allowed it to continue as before, there would be no movement,
and therefore no succession of time; and one instant would be a hun-
dred years in length. This is in flat contradiction to Wyclif's doctrine
of eternal time, consisting of instants‚ each of which requires another
immediately following it; so he is at some pains to refute the possibility
of such a hypothesis The instant is an individual quantity, which can
neither be lessened nor increased. If it could, it would contain many
instantS, and thus be no longer one only. A short time would equal a
long one; the essence of time would no longer consist in duration alone,
for nothing could differentiate the too-century instant from an ordinary
one. ln conclusion, Wyclif dismisses this theory with contempt (170-173).

Wyclifs vieni. Is extends itself really to all time, past and future.
Whatever is, is always, as has been shown. Ι1 not, we deny the very
essence of time. Its parts ⁸do not coexist, bnt vanish as fast as they
appear; yet they are5 now in the. past, now in the future: and again,
in a wider present they may be said to coexist. This is clearly signihed
by the sense of the verb Js, which by itself does not connote any given
instant of time, and therefore signifies eternity (173- 177).

Objections refuted. -- To say that all instants‚ because they are
together in eternnl time, are together with absolute simultaneity, is but
a sophism. Simultaneity requires that two things bc together at the same
instant or instants‚ and at no others. Now one instant cannot exist exactly
when another does, but either before or after ( 77—179). ·— The often
urged ‘necessity of all things’ may be admitted, if understood as merely
conditional upon God’s will; for whatever is determinately true, is neces·
sarily true, and there is no such thing as indeterminate truth. Hypo·
thetical necessity, as this is, does notdeny contingency, nor the free-will
,01 man, nor chance. 'Phe hypothetical fact that God foreknows anything‚
