INTRODUCTION. XXV

in different parts. No quality is essentially inherent to primordial matter;
therefore, nothing can contradict it. A body composed of parts which
come and go successively may receive different and contrary qualities,
and yet remain the same; as, v. g., the Mediterranean may ebb and
flow, and yet he the same sea (124-127). Thus, when we say, This
is hot, we speak of the compound alone3 it is that mhich is hot.v Here

comes a digression. How can hest, the proper quality of fire, he found

in water, which is naturally cold? Particles of fire may be mingled with
the water, though they are in a violent state; the water, if left to itself,
will soon again become cold. However mingled the different elements
may he, they still obey the laws which govern their nature (128-130).
The chapter closes with a short survey of creation, beginning with the
elements which, uniting, form vapours; these produce metals and earths3
the earths, if mingled with fire and water, bring forth plants and also
animals in an ascendiug scale of forms, the lower hardly distinguishable
from inanimate beings, the highest, quasi-immaterial. The soul of man
is completely so; and each higher form includes in its perfectiori that
of the lower ones (rso-132).
