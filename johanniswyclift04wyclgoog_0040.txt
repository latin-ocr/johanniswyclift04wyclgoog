XXXII INTRODUCTION.

fact of its happening, on the will of God. — The use of the present
for the past and the future cannot be blamed as an abuse of terms,
nor as the denial of expositorialsyllogisms. No logician should use it
thus when he is likely to be misunderstood through ignorance; but it is
allowed to speak otherwise to philosophers than to the common people.
Neither the expositorial syllogism, nor any other, is denied by Wyclif' s
theory, which on the contrary admits many forms of syllogism that others
deny. - A curious difficulty is raised here by the adversaries (195).
Wyclif is certain that he has had no son. Yet perhaps his son is wiser
than he; for he possibly may have a son yet. If this son ‘will be’, then ‘he
is’¹ according to the theory which extends the future to the present.
Wyclif denies this conclusion, unless it is certain that he will have a
son. At first sight it does not clearly appear how this ean be denied
in the vform given. “Filius meus ex milti dubio esset sapiencior me.'’

A supposition that depends upon another supposition is quite thinkable. t
Rutwe must here remember Wyclif's doctrine- that the distinction

between extrinsic and intrinsie possibility has no real foundation; that a ¹

seemingly possible creature is in reality impossible, if God has chosen

never to create it (See Logica vol. Π., Inte. XXIV). We have the right y
to deny the possibility of Wyclif s ever having ason in the future, ,

unless we are certain that he will have one. Perhaps the individual in ³

question is possible; God knows; but we know nothing at all about j

him (1 -1 .

the arguments contrary to his own opinion (199-202), and then refutes

them one by one. Even if the world were not everywhere, it would not

follow that time is not everywhere. But as a fact, the world being ¹

(partially) in each and all of its parts, that argument must fall to the
ground (202). -Itis denied that the world has any unity whatever,
' being a mere aggregate; and time, an accident belonging to the world, '
cannot have more unity than its subject. But Wyclis points out that the

laws of nature give unity to this aggregate, justas political laws give 3

unity to an aggregate or assembly of men. Besides, the world, not·
withstanding changes, remains the same in its efficient cause- God - f
— and also in its material cause - the atoms of which it consists.

lf we grant that the world is animated, its unity becomes much more
evidere, now, wc have many proofs that it really isan animated
