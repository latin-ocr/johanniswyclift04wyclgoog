XXVI lNTRODUCTlON.

Is the known ivhereoer ils knotver is? — No ; lor then everything
would be, as God is, everywhere (133, 134)· Itis objected that every·
thing is truth‚ and that truth, like God, is everywhere. We may, how·
ever, admit this, restricting the sense of being in space to filling nat space
quantitatively. Thus, granting the force oi the argument, we nevertheless
deny it in the signification usually given to words. Christ's Body has size in
the Sacrament, yet it does not properly fill space; it is present without
either position or shape. The bread is not annihila'ted3 what remains is a
purely mathematical body, but not nothing; the sacramental sign is the
reality ol Christ’s Body (134—137). lt may be urged that the fact ol
movement is not extended in space, and that movement is consequently

everywhere. But local movement is the'movement of a body, and must

be extended with that to which it belongs Virtues, again, exist throughout
the whole man, body and soul; but they are nowhere else but where
their subject is. When a part moves, the whole may be said to move,
it is true; only in a different way (139, 140). Movement thus takes its
determination (individuacionem suam) either from its subject alone, qna
subject, or from the subject with all its integral parts, or from this with
the velocity also taken into account. The third point ol view implies the
first and the second ; but not vice versa. Wherever there is a more in·
dividual movement, there is also a more universal one; and in this
sense, movement as a universal, is everywhere, according to Aristotle
(140, 141). God indeed is all truth everywhere; yet truth, as created, is
not identical with God, and it were a iallacy to draw such an inserence.
The sense of words in these questions depends much on their position
in the sentence. “It is non possible for a given future instant to exist’³,
and, “It is possible ior a given luture instant to exist now”‚ are two
widely different propositions. God’s knowledge ol everything is absolutely
houndless. No time exists lor Him. He is means He is yeslerday, or He
roas to-ntorrotu; existing at once in all eternity -— an instant to Him.
—- He comprises all duration in His being (141-143); and therefore His
existence is an eternal Non. - Again‚ we have a similar sophism: “That
may necessarily be which cannot be necessarily.” This is false, but
only when understood oi absolute, not of hypothetical necessity. Α
future instant is necessarily “about to be”‚ at a time when it cannot
possibly be “about to be’'. All this is mere soolish subtlety; we go no
sarther than to say that, ii at any moment it is true that a given being
