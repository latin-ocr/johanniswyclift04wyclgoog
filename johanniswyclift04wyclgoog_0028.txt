XXII INTRODUCTION.

one is continually brought into being; take the velocity common to each
01 these at each instant, and you get the speed 01 the whole (96).

Here comes a curious passage, in which Wyclif is led to state the
exact rapidity 01 the swistest movement possible, viz. one point per
instant. It seems to us that, in continuous movement, whether slow or
quick‚ one point- an infinitely small distance - is always passed over
in the infinitely small interval 01000 1001001. This is denied. 10 011 move·
ments which are slower 11100 that 01 1110 Equator 01 the First Mobile,
we have two, three, four... ‚instants during which the point is
0011001000, and then passes instantaneously 00 10 1110 next place, which
is infinitely near (oy-99). 10 011 111000 remarks, and elsewhere, as the
reader will doubtless perceive‚ there is adim perception 01 the non-
equality 01 infinitesimal quantities3 but the state 01 Μο11101001100 was not
then sufficiently advanced to 100101 1110 idea, and Wyclil himself, though
10110 01110000 01 1110 11100, was more 01 0 metaphysician 11100 010
mathematician. His conception, 11 carried into the field 01 pure Mathe·
matics, might possibly have bad good results; understood in the Realistic
sense, they came to nothing.

Alogical quibble about the possibility 01 1001001000000 change
(whether, between the instant 01 changing and that 01 having changed,

there is any interval) brings our author to a short digression upon death,

which takes place in two instants. ln the first, the 1000 dies; in the
second, he is dead; 101 we cannot say, he is dead at the instant when
11011100, nor he dies at the instant when he is dead. Other writers
would say that the instant 01 death is the same in both cases; but
viewed from different standpoints: as the end 01 1110, 0011 1110 beginning
01 000-1110. This, Wyclil sayS, is impossible (100).

Astronomical objections, 0- The assertion that the Equator alone
moves one point per instant is beset with many difficulties. The First
Mobile is a perfect sphere3 its movements therefore ought at all points,
and not only at the Equator, to be unisorm. But every point in the First

. Mobile does not touch euery other: so the smaller 0110100, makinga

shorter journey in the same time, will not require to move so 1001. The
circle tangent to the Equator has but one point lewer than the Equator;
performing its journey in the same time, it will remain immobile 101 000
1001001, 10 make up 101 1110 missing point: which ol the points is missing
we need not enquire. - The Poles belong to the great 0110100,
