by denying that at each instant of any movement one point is passed
over; it is the case only for the swiftest movement possible, that of
the ‘equinoctial point’ in the sky (38, 39). — Itis true that such an
answer does away with all really continuous motion, except for the said
point: during any slower movement from A to B, the mobile C would
be at rest in a multitude of points; and thus rest would he identical
with movement. But movement may appear to be continuous, though it
is not really so; a succession of very shortmotions, interspersed with restS,
will give us the feeling of continuity. As a fact, our senses often mislead
us; as, for instance, in certain phenomena of sight, and in the vibrations
of which sound consists. lf the most rapid possible movement is at the
rate of one point per instant, it follows that the world cannot be larger
than it is; for if larger, it would revolve more rapidly, and that is im-
possible: a confirmation of what has been proved elsewhere and other·
wise (39, 42). — “But if the apices of several pyramids touched, they v
would be in thesame place, and thus coi'ncide.’³ This is merely begging
the question. lf a point has position of its own, it cannot be in the
same place with another. — lt is said that in Wyclifs system each point
must touch an infinity of others3 which leads to difficulties. But this is denied.
Six points only touch a seveuth placed in their midst. Thus in certain
directions one cannot go immediately from one point to the next; their
position follows certain fixed rules, somewhat like the grain in wood, ¹
or the lines of cleavage in crystals. A line drawn from one point to
another which it cannot touch directly‚ only by means ofa third, is

nevertheless not bent; for it is as straight as a line can possibly be.
To say, the point A touches B, and B, C; therefore, A touches C, is
a sophism. All this is indeed unimaginable; but we must go beyond

imagination when we have to deal with the Inexlended. And at any rate, ·

Nominalists have no right to argue at all in the matter (42—46).

Here Wyclif enters into a series of explanations on the different
senses given to the words point, line, sursace and angle, and he expounds
what he conceives to be Euclid's meaning. An angle may mean either
its apex, or the space which it encloses; two very different things
(46—49). But the adversaries point out that either an angle is indefini-
tely great3 which Wyclif denieS, assuming that any angle is complete in
its apex (49, 50); or that any number of angles, small and great,
may coexist at the same point3 which is granted as a harmless
