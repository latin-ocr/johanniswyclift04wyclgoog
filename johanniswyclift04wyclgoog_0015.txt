posited. They arethe subject of the accidental qualities which we
perceive; and though Wyelif calls them a corpus mathematicum, they
are real objective existences‚ and not the atoms of Christ’s Body. 'lhat
Body, as l pointed out in the· Introduction to De Apostasia, is present
there as a symbol - and is therefore really present with the reality of
a symbol - but not otherwise. ls not this in substance the very same
theory that Wyelif expounds in his later works? There is indeed a com-
plete change of language aud st'yle, though even so late as in the tractate
De Apostasia, he continues to employ the term transubstantiation; but
here, even from the very outset, he refuses to admit that anythiug in
the physical substance of the bread has been changed.

Such are the most important points in this third volume of Logica;
their bearing both upon what preceded them and what followed, justifies
me, l think, in setting them before the reader in connected form. Here
and there, we also find certain other allusions‚ paragraphs upon necessity
and free-will, aword or two against the abuse of ceremonies and the
excess of riches in the Church, and other signs which show what was
already fermenting in Wyelif s mind3 but they are mere side-issues, and
not (so far as l can see now) essentially connected with his system.
They' will, therefore, be more advantageously considered in their place,
as we go on to the detailed examination of the two last chapters of
Wyelif s Logica.
