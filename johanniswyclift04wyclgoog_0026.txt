each other until the final evolution ol the elements. All this time the
elementa were in potentia - remotissimo, remota, proximas then
in actu primo remoto in actu primo proximo, and at last in actu
secundo.

Wyclis continues to 'urge the point against his adversaries. lf we
get the elements out of the compound, they must have been there besore;
and many instances go to prove that they actually exist there; for
instance, the phosphorescence of fishes’ scales in the dark is attributable
to the actual existence ol fire (77). And as a lact, we smd in combina-
tions the same qualities as were before in the elements; or is not, a

mean between them; or their reaction in the compound may even pro·

duce a quality. There is no need to suppose that the former qualities
are destroyed because they do not appear (78, 79). Ι have added the
last clause as the answer of such philosophers as dispute with the
modern Thomists, who point out that carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen
are harmless, and that prussic aeid is a violent poison. The poisonous
quality is merely the reactiou upon each other ol various qualities os
the three component elements.

To this the adversaries reply that such a compound would be but
a mere aggregate of atoms ‘which a man that had the lynx’s eyes might
see separate'. Wyclil’s answer is that oi the modern chemical school3
they are not mere aggregates: roho! dffrrntiates the compound istite
relative position osone aloru to another (80). But, it is urged, if the
elemental forms are everywhere in the compound, the superadded torm
of the compound must be nowhere. Wyclil replies that this form is every·
where in the whole, and to a certain extent, indivisibly so, being less
material than the elementary forms, 'l‘here is something of the universal
in these higher forms, which exist partially in each atom‚ considered as
part os the compound (80-81). -—- One last difficulty. ln this system,
the whole world is oue being3 and one only, since all points touch,
from the centre to the extreme point where space ceases to be possible.
-- Itis quite true, answers Wyclii‚ that the world is one being; but it
does not follow that everything in the world is one. One being may be
separated from another by a third. Continuity does not mean'sameness
ol nature. Every part oi the world joins in and airls the harmonious
action ol the whole; all things aremade forman, and it is-for that
reason that all the elements concur to form his orgaus os sense, aud
