that some ol them predominate in certain ol' the elements, and others
in certain others (82—85).

What is the measure of velocity os motion? - Not, says Wychf,
the space gone over by the mobile in a given time. This seems para·
doxical; butan example, given directly afterwards, shows that our author
is thinking, notos the distance in length, but of the whole surlace gone
over. A large body and a small one, though moving with equal speed,
will go through very unequal spaces in the same time. Whal measures
the motion of any body is the point of maximum swiltness, which in
every case must exist, and must exist somewhere at the surface of the
moving body; there is also a point where the movement is reduced to
a minimum, but Wyclil, somewhat unaccountably, restricts this proposition
to living beings that move (86). Now the measure os velocity os a body
is the line described by the point which moves fastest (87, 94).

Gerteral arguments against Wyclifs position. —· The First
Mobile, being the outermost sphere, and having no space beyond it,
can describe no line at all3 planets have many movements, and no point
can be said to describe them all at the same time. Again, if we suppose
a given length passed over in a given time, this may be done by
mobiles os infinitely varying velocities‚ which would all have this length
and time for the measure ol their respective velocities. And we can con·
ceive the case of a body continually losing its swiltest point by the
very fact oi its movement: which would refute the assertion that-every
mobile must have such a point (87, 88). This last objectionis urged,
from p. 89 to p. 92, in a long argument which l have been utterly
unable to follow. Wyclif then points out that the reason lor which some
deny the general idea of movement (abstracting from its rapidity, and
allowing a general measure ol velocity for the whole mobile) is in reality
the doctrine ol Nominalism. Nominalists do notwant to admit a universal
idea ol movement which exists even in bodies at rest, when acted upon
by contrary forces (94). The movement oi a body is as swilt as that
os its swiltest part3 this swiltness is the measure ol the whole (ia). As
to the objections that ol the First Mobile has no value whatever. What
that sphere describes may nothe formally called a line, but it is equi-
valent to a line. Planets have not many movementS, but one which is

tantamount to many (unus motus, habens racionem diversorum motuum) (95).

If, in the last case, the point os greatest velocity is continually lost, a new
