only as long as the side. Each parallel intersects the diagonal at several

absurd to suppose that two lines which intersect at a very acute angle

Ξ. do not touch by more points than when they are perpendicular3 or

si„ that these parallels would]¹ no longer be straight aster intersection:

r'a the touching in several points does not change their direction. This
su somewhat risky ¹answer is supported by the assertion that the ultimate

ii· equares (consisting ol two points each) are beyond the scope of geometry;
also by some remarks concerning the position of points relatively to the

— poles ol the world (55, 56), which I, not clearly seeing their relevancy
ii to the subject, prefer to pass over. But 1 think it is at this part os the

hook that we get nearest to the weak point in Wyclifs system: viz.

Wyclif eomes to the conclusion that God alone knows what the

r real proportion ol the diagonal ol a square to its side is; sor it depends

on the number oi points touched by all the intersecting lines parallel
to that side. Geometry may fflaps be true only hypothetically; it can “’
prove that the proportion Va exists in the whole diagonal, but not

⁸ that it exists in every part of that line (57). The admission that in every
ξ line there is a certain number ol points, ol course implies the denial

of all incommensurable quantities; that is, absolutely incommensurable‚

Ι they are odd or even (58-60).

Another perplexing question concerns the shape os the smallest
figures possible, which consist ol a sew points only. Are they circles‚
triangleS, spheres, pyramids, or what? They may be maintained-to be

unimaginable realities in their extreme smaliness. We cannot even con-
ceive them distinctly by the intellect‚ at least in its present state os
union with matter (oo-63).
