ol space were lilled with indivisible impenetrable atomS, should anything
increase in size', the whole universe would become larger than it can
possibly be. Yet rarefaction must be admitted3 and a like argument has
the same weight as regards condensation. Wyclif, in his reply, at once
declares that he does not admit the possibility ofa body occupying
more or less space without gain or loss ol matter. Rarefaction, there·
sore, and condensation also are denied in this sense, but admitted in
another. On account ol the accession or the removal of another body,
a substance may seem to increase or diminish in size3 ae, v. g., smoke
seems to spread itself out and sill a room, whereas it is in reality mixed
with the air. This is the only sense in which rarefaction is possible,
and it answers all the objections, We need not follow our author through
the mazes of Mediaeval physics which he threads‚ nor inquire whether
this view would destroy nll difference between the clements ol sire, air,
water and earth (63-70). Wyclil ends by stating, as his opinion, that
the compenetration of two bodies is an utter impossibility. This conclu-
sion evidently ssows from his doctrine. Two pointS, having no dimensional
qualities »- nothing but position - would, if they coi'ncided‚ lose even
that essential quality, and be nothing at all. But it raises grave theolo-
gical difficulties3 for the School generally admits that God’s Omnipotence
can make two bodies occupy the same space.

Ohjerlr'ons drawn from theology. Since spiritual forms² having more
perfect entity than matter, can occupy the same space with it, then a
fortiori matter can be coextended with matter. Besides, the glorified
bodies ol the Saints possess the gist ol subtlety, i. e. of passing through
matter3 which seems to imply compenetration. - The answer is a
repeated denial ol its possibility (71). The gilt ol subtlety, bestowed on
glorihed bodieS, is somewhat perplexing; but there are various ways of ex-
plaining it without admitting compenetration (72, 73).

Objections drnrvn from chernical combinatione — II every punctal
atom is and remains eternally the same, then the elements would remain
in their compounds; size would be made up ol that which has no size,
and movement ol what is not properly movement, as one point passes

instantaneously into the place of another. — 'l‘he first ol these con-
clusions is granted by Wyclil, though the question itsell waS, during the
whole of the Middle Ages, a battle-field sor the rival sections of the
School. The 'l‘homists maintained that iu all chemical combinatione,
