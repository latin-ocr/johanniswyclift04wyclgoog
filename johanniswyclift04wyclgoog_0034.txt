XXVI lNTRODUCTlON.

Is the known ivherever ils knotver 131- Νο; for then everything
would be, as God is, everywhere (133, 134). Itis objected that every-
thing is truth, and that truth, like God, is everywhere. We may, how-
ever, admit this, restricting the sense of being in space to filling that space
qllantitatioely. Thus, granting the force ol the argument, we nevertheless
deny it in the signification usually given to words Christ’s Body has size in
the Sacrament, yet it does not properly fill space; itis present without
either position or shape. The bread is not annihila'ted3 what remains is a
purely mathematical body, but not nothing; the sacramental sign is the
-reality of Christ’s Body (134—137). lt may be urged that the fact of
movement is not extended in space, and that movement is consequently

everywhere. But local movement is themovement os a body, and must

be extended with that to which it belongs Virtues, again, exist throughout
the whole man, body and soul; but they are nowhere else but where
their subject is. When a part moveS, the whole may be said to move,
it is true; only in a different way (139, 140). Movement thus takes its
determination (individuacionem suam) either lrom its subject alone, qno
subject, or lrom the subject with all its integral parts, or from this with
the velocity also taken into account. The third point ol view implies the
first and the second ; but not vice versa. Wherever there is a more in·
dividual movement, there is also a more universal one; and in this
sense, movement as a universal, is everywhere, according to Aristotle
(140, 141). God indeed is all truth everywhere; yet truth, as created, is
not identical with God, and it were a lallacy to draw such au inlerence.
The sense ol words in these questions depends much on their position
in the sentence. <‘It is now possible for a given future instant to exist”,
and, “lt is possible for a given luture instant to exist now”, are two
widely different propositions God’s knowledge ol everything is absolutely
boundless. No time exists ior Him. He is means He is westerday, or He
toas to-morrow,· existing at once in all eternity -- an instant to Him,
—- He comprises all duration in His being (141-143); and therefore His
existence is an eternal Non). -— Again, we have a similar sophism: “That
may necessarily be which cannot be necessarily.” This is false, but
only when understood ol absolute, not of hypothetical necessity. Α
luture instant is necessarily ιεαὺοιιί to be’', ata time when it cannot
possibly be “about to be’'. All this is mere soolish subtlety; we go no
farther than to say that, if at any moment itis true that a given being
