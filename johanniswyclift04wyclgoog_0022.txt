conclusion (50, 51); and that our author's system would imply the denial,
not only ofEuclid’s definition ol angles, but ol the whole os his treatise r

on the subject. (Here, by the way, we may note how quietly the tri- l

section ol an angle is taken lor granted “secundum doctrinam prime
Vitulonis”, i. e. Vitellio, the famous Mediaeval mathematician and optician ’
“que docet angulum rectum datum in tres partes dividere”, whereas all
mathematicians are at present agreed that suclr trisection is impossible.
As, however, Ι have not been able to get a sight ol Vitellio’s workS,
though living in the very city in which he wrote them,¹ 1 am not quite sure
that what he teaches is anything more than a mere practical way os divid-
ing an angle into three partS, without any claim to absolute exactitude.)

Wyclif replies that, as regards Euclid's definition ol the angle —
the meeting of two lines - this is merely a genetic, notan essential
definition. Euclid indeed says what causes an angle; but that is not the
angle itsels. As to the rest, the answer is ready: Euclid’s theory con·
cerns only sensible angles, not such as are found amongst points which
touch; such, lor instance, as form triangles which have sides only two
points long, and os which the apex is an angle which cannot be
bisected‚ &e - All this cannot be imagined, and should, therefore, be
denied from a merely geometrical point ol view (52, 55).

We corne now to what is perhaps the strongest mathematical ob-
jection to Wyclifs system. According to him, points are placed as fol-
lows, in a small square ol say, 25 points only; Ι have added the con·
necting hyphens in the subjoined figure to show which points touch, and

·-· for the given square, all but infinitesimally small, will also

any square (containing an equal number of points) will be equal to its
side, the greater to the less: which is absurd (53, 54). — Wyclil's
reply admits as an evident lact that the diagonal ol a square is longer
than its side. But when he comes to the statement that parallel lines,
