INTRODUCTION. XXVII

will exist, the being is iu the future (143-145). At different times that
which is white is black, a man differs from himself, &c.; but this implies
no absurdity. Becoming is a change, not of the subject, hut ol its
‘suchness’ An instantaneous change does not imply an infinitely swift
movement‚ lor the idea ol swiftness implies that ol time, not of one
instant only (145—147).

A great many fallacies are brought lorward against this position,
such as that, v. g.‚ is future whiteness be always predicable of an indi·
vidual, that individual will always be white; so that il at any time he
were black, he would bave and not have two essential contradictory
qualities; or that a king cannot have been baptized, il, when baptized,
he was not yet a king; and so on ad infinitum. They all belong to the
class os fallaciae accidentis· “What you have bought, you have eaten;
but you have bought raw meat; therefore you have eaten raw meat.’'
T he change from black to white is one, not of nature, but of quality.
The individual differs 'from himself modally‚ not essentially. The ‘being a
king' isin a man amere accidental quality; the king has been baptized,
not as a king, butas a man. “He who is now a king, was baptized
when not a king’', is perfectly true. Much depends on the compound
or the divided sense in which terms may he taken. “He who is begotten
is David the kiag; David tlte king and raho is bagatten belong, as pre-
dicates, to the verb is, in the divided, not in the compound sense.

Besides, the act ol begetting is not instantaneous; it has many pre-
paratory acts (147-154). - There are also several theological argu-
ments on p. 150, concerning the possibility of God's assuming the per·
sonality of all creatores, which Wyclis brieily meets by denying (154,
155) in direct opposition to Aquinas (Sum. Th. p. 5ξι qu. ΙΙΙ. art. 5, ό).

Are all things together, both in time aad place? — Wyclil first

of all gives the arguments contra. If it were so, there would no longer
be any distance between things· The future and the past would exist
etemally; a man would both exist and not exist in the same (eternal)
time. Again‚ whatever takes place in any partos space and time, must
take place there only and only then; its existence cannot possibly be
extended any larther (155). On the other hand, the world is everywhere ;
yet the rahole world is not in any partos space; and in like manner,
is anythiug exists at any time, its then existence is true in all time; and
so also oi space (156). ·— Wyclil thinks that this question arises mainly
