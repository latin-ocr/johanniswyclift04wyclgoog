lN'l'RODUCTlON. XXVII

will exist, the being is 111 the future (145-145). Α1 different times that
which is white is black, 3 man differs from himself, &c.; hut this implies
no absurdity. Becoming is a change, not of the subject, but of its
‘suchness’ An instantaneous change does not imply an infinitely swift
movement, for the idea of swiftness implies that of time, not of one
instant only (145-147).

A great many fallacies are brought forward against this position,
such as that, v. g., if future whiteness be always predicable of 311111111-
vidual, that individual will always be white; so that if at any time he
were black, he would have and not have two essential contradictory
qualities3 or that a king cannot have been baptized, if, when baptized,
he was not yet a king; and so on ad infinitum. They all belong to the
class of fallaciae accidentis “What you have bought, you have eaten3
but you have bought raw meat; therefore you have caten raw meat.’'
The change from black to white is one, not of nature, but of quality.
The individual differs 'from himself modally, not essentially. The ‘being a
king' isin a man a mere accidental quality; the king has been baptized,
not as a king, butas a man. “He who is now a king, was baptized
when not a king”, is perfectly true. Much depends on the compound
or the divided sense in which terms may be taken. “He who is begotten
is Dauid the king; David tae king and 111110 is bagatten belong, as pre·
dicateS, to the verb is, in the divided‚ not in the compound sense.

Besides, the act of begetting is not instantaneous; it has many pre·
paratory acts (147-154). - There are also several theological argu·
ments on p. 150, concerning the possibility of God's assuming the per·
sonality of all creatures, which Wyclif briefly meets by denying (154,
155) in direct opposition to Aquinas (Sum. Th. p. 3² qu. llI. art. 5, ὁ).

Are all things together, both in time and place? — Wyclif frrst

of all gives the arguments contra. If it were s0, there would no longer
be any distance between things The future and the past would exist
eternally; a man would both exist and not exist in the same (eternal)
time. Again, whatever takes place 111 any part of space and time, must
take place there only and only then; its existence cannot possibly be
extended any farther (155). On the other hand, the world is everywhere;
yet the rahole world is not in any part of space; and in like manner,
if anything exists at any time, its then existence is true in all time; and
so also of space (156). -— Wyclif thinks that this question arises mainly
