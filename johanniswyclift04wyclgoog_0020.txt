XIV INTRODUCTION.

all that goes beyond our power 01 conception, even though the thing
be 001 infinite in itsels. Anumber, therefore, which is infinite to one man

will be finite to another; and none is infinite 10 Divine Intelligence. This

evidently llows from Wyclif’s conception 01 maxima and minima. There
is a fixed number of all things - even 01 100 points in 0 1100 - which,

infinite to us, is finite to God; and no straight line can be infinitely
long (37⁹ 38),

As this conception 01 the infinite may give rise to the inquiry
how far our author is in agreement with the majority 01 Scholastic
philosophers, a short digression is not out 01 place here, and l shall
proceed brielly to state the points on which there is the least contradic-
tion among Schoolmen in this matter.

The Infinite means ‘that beyond which nothing greater can be
conceived, whether by human thought, or by any other intelligence‚
however perfect. 11 00 substance or being can be conceived greater, it
is the Absolute 10110110- God; 11 no accident, thenit is the relative
lnfinite — 01 quantity (multitude or magnitude) or 01 quality. The Infi-
nite cannot be made up 01 110110 parts ; it is not the mere negation, but
the negation 01 0 negotium and thus has a positive meaning. Infinite
magnitude 01 1001101 is impossible; so is 00 infinite number, an infinite
multitude, and a movement infinitely swilt. Infinite imperfectiori or badness
is also inadmissible; 101 11 would totally destroy any substance in which
it inhered3 001 qualities that denote nothing 001 perfectiori, such as soree,
lile, duration, &c must be admitted in God; in the human soul ton, ’
001 only 11010 0 0011010 point of view, “secundum quid''. This Infinite
“secundum quid'³ is in general predicated 01 that which is finite 10 every
sense but one; as, e. g., the two halves 01 00 infinite line, 01 01 infinite
· space. ln this sense, and from the point osvierv from which it is finite,
one infinite may be greater than another. ·- Clearly the term, as
employed by Wyclis, has quite another meaning, unless when he applies
11 10 God.

Ohjections based upon geometry. —- Ι1 Wyclil’s theory be true, then
the number 01 points is the same in two 11003, 000 01 which is double
01 1110 011101. For two mobiles, passing over each 01 thern, one double
as [astas the other, correspondingly to the length 01 1110 lines, will go
over them in the same number 01 instante, and therefore that same
number 01 points will be passed in that time. The difficulty is solved
