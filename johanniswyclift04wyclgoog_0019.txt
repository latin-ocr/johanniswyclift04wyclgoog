to the same conclusion (32). — 6. There are days and nights hutone
instant long (as at the poles). These days and nights are part os the
continuity of time, and yet are distinct from the rest os it; therefore they
are real parts, which make up that continuity. And is Time is thus com-
posed, it is easy to show that space is composed likewise (33). -
7. Ι( God, by His almighty Power, created a series of substances each
the size ol a mathematical point, and placed them side by side throughout
the whole of space, we should have continuous extension3 and nothing
can be brought to prove that what is possible in this caseis nota
really existing fact (34). — Throughout the whole of these arguments, our
author seems at times to take the idea ol the absolutely inextended point
- the Nothing ol Space - and at others, that os a line divided by
“a quantity that has increased beyond all measure’'. The latter, accord-
ing to modern mathematicianS, is not absolutely without length; only
its length is shorter than the shortest line conceivable. Such infinitesimal
magnitudes would indeed be lactors of the line; but would they agree
with Wyclil’s conception os the point, as an absolute minimum ol hulk?

The line A, divided by 00, gives ἓ but ΖΑ, divided in like manner,

gives ἐξ the second quantity is mathematically double ol the first. But

l leave these considerations to such as are versed in a science which,

since live hundred years, has made such progress as Wyclif never
dreamed os. ’

Arguments eontra: Aristotle's view. — The difficulties which surround
such a system are ol course great andmanifold. Aristotle seems against
it; for instance, when he says that the Continuous is infinitely divisible.
But, a) Aristotle speaks ol that which is continuous to our senses; and
that, so far as our senses castell, is indeed made up ol innumerable
parts. But though infinite lor us, they are not so to God. And, b) Ari·
stotle distinctly says that the point is the cause os the line; isso, it
must be its clement, and this dictum is quite in Wyelif s favour (35).
The doctrine of indivisible points transcends both our senses and our
imagination. Geometry has nothing to do here, these points are beyond
geometry3 physics are out ol court, they belong to metaphysie. God
alone knows how many points go to form a given square, but their
number is not infinite to Him (36). The word ‘Infinite’ is used to denote
